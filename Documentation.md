# Job Recommendation System Documentation

## Overview

The Job Recommendation System is a Flask-based web application that recommends job listings to users based on their skills and preferences. The system uses a skill-based matching algorithm to suggest suitable jobs and provides a RESTful API for retrieving job listings and getting recommendations.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

* **Frontend**: The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface for users to interact with the system.
* **Backend**: The backend is built using Flask, a Python web framework. It provides a RESTful API for retrieving job listings and getting recommendations.
* **Database**: The database is built using MongoDB, a NoSQL database. It stores job listings and user profiles.

## API Endpoints

The system provides the following API endpoints:

* **GET /jobs**: Retrieves a list of job listings.
* **GET /jobs/{job_id}**: Retrieves a specific job listing by ID.
* **POST /recommend**: Gets job recommendations for a user based on their skills and preferences.
* **POST /users**: Creates a new user profile.
* **GET /users/{user_id}**: Retrieves a specific user profile by ID.

## Data Models

The system uses the following data models:

* **Job**: Represents a job listing.
	+ **id**: Unique identifier for the job.
	+ **title**: Title of the job.
	+ **description**: Description of the job.
	+ **skills**: List of skills required for the job.
	+ **location**: Location of the job.
* **User **: Represents a user profile.
	+ **id**: Unique identifier for the user.
	+ **name**: Name of the user.
	+ **email**: Email address of the user.
	+ **skills**: List of skills possessed by the user.
	+ **preferences**: List of job preferences (e.g., location, job type).

## Algorithm

The system uses a skill-based matching algorithm to suggest suitable jobs to users. The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Skill Matching**: The system matches the user's skills with the skills required for each job listing.
2. **Score Calculation**: The system calculates a score for each job listing based on the number of matching skills.
3. **Ranking**: The system ranks job listings based on their scores, with higher scores indicating better matches.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

The system makes the following assumptions and design decisions:

* **Skill Importance**: The system assumes that all skills are equally important for matching.
* **Partial Matches**: The system allows partial skill matches rather than requiring all skills to match.
* **Database Choice**: The system uses MongoDB as the database due to its flexibility with unstructured data.

## Challenges and Solutions

The system encountered the following challenges and solutions:

* **Challenge**: Handling variations in skill names (e.g., "Python" vs "Python Programming").
	+ **Solution**: The system uses a skill normalization process to standardize skill names.
* **Challenge**: Scalability concerns with a large number of job listings.
	+ **Solution**: The system uses database indexing on frequently queried fields to improve performance.

## Future Improvements

The system can be improved in the following ways:

* **Machine Learning**: The system can use machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of job recommendations.
* **Location-Based Filtering**: The system can use location-based filtering to suggest jobs that are closer to the user's location.
* **User  Feedback**: The system can use user feedback to improve the accuracy of job recommendations over time.
